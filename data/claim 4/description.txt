Dear Sir or Madam,

I am requesting reimbursement for a flight I was unable to take due to a sudden illness in December. I had planned to travel for the holidays but became unwell just days before my departure.

On December 21st, 2022, I was examined by a doctor in Brussels and was declared unfit to work from December 22 through December 24 due to illness. A medical certificate was issued at the time (attached). Although the illness was not prolonged, I was advised to rest and avoid travel until fully recovered.

As a result, I had to cancel my flight originally scheduled for December 23, 2022. Please find my booking and medical certificate enclosed.

I hope this qualifies under the CFSR policy.

Thank you for your help,  
Louis Ndembele
