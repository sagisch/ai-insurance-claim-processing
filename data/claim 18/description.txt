To whom it may concern,

I am submitting this claim regarding a flight I was unable to board on December 14, 2024, due to an unforeseen medical emergency. I experienced acute abdominal pain the night before the flight and was admitted to [HOSPITAL_NAME] in [CITY].

I have attached the official hospital admission and discharge documentation. I was advised not to travel for at least 48 hours following the treatment.

The flight in question was booked through my employer’s travel portal.

I kindly request reimbursement or rescheduling of this ticket in accordance with my insurance policy’s coverage for medical emergencies.

Sincerely,
Daniel Romero
