To whom it may concern,

I am filing a claim for reimbursement of my flight, which I was unable to take due to a sudden medical emergency that required hospitalization and surgery.

On August 13, 2011, I was admitted to Clinique Médicale de Bassam for acute pelvic pain, cardiac distress, and gallbladder complications. The attending physician, Dr. Kouassi Kone Francois, diagnosed me with biliary colic and cholelithiasis and ordered an urgent surgical intervention. Due to this, I could not proceed with my scheduled travel.

Please find attached the official hospitalization certificate as proof of my condition. I request a refund of the flight.

Sincerely,  
Evelyne Kacou Meitiale
