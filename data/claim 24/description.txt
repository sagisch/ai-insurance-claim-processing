To whom it may concern,

I am writing to request a refund for a train journey I was unable to take on February 2, 2017, due to a medical issue that worsened the day before travel.

While I did not seek medical attention immediately, the following day I visited the Hospital General Docente Calderón in Quito and was diagnosed with sinusitis (ICD-10: J66). I had been experiencing symptoms for several days, but on the morning of the trip, I felt too unwell to travel and made the difficult decision to stay home.

The medical certificate issued by Dr. Elizabeth Cueva confirms my condition and the consultation on February 5, 2017. I understand the appointment was not on the same day as the scheduled trip, but I hope you will consider the documentation as valid support for my request. The illness clearly impacted my ability to travel.
