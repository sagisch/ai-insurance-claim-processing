Dear Customer Support,

I am writing to request a refund for a train I was unable to board on September 20, 2013, due to an acute medical condition.

On the same day, I was diagnosed with gastroenteritis by Dr. Líder Pinargote C. in Buenos Aires. The doctor prescribed hydration, general medication, and 72 hours of rest. Due to this sudden illness and the recommended recovery period, I was unable to travel as planned and missed my scheduled train.

I have attached the official medical certificate issued by the attending physician to support my request. Given the unforeseen medical emergency, I kindly ask you to consider a refund for the unused ticket.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
Marcos Junes
