To whom it may concern,

I am writing to request a refund for a flight I was unable to take on **February 27, 2020**, due to a serious accident that required urgent medical attention.

On that day, I was treated at the Emiro Quintero Cañizares Hospital in Ocaña after sustaining multiple injuries, including facial trauma, nasal fractures, and an oblique fracture in the upper arm. The attending physician recommended immediate rest and recovery.

I was given a signed and sealed document issued by Dr. Jorge Andrez Arias Castro, which confirms the diagnosis and circumstances of my hospitalization. I can provide this document upon request.

Due to this unexpected and incapacitating medical emergency, I was unable to attend my scheduled flight. I kindly ask that you take this situation into consideration and approve a refund for the unused ticket.

Thank you very much for your understanding.
