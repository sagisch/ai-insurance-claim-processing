I am writing to request a refund for a hotel reservation that I was unable to use on December 14, 2015, due to a medical emergency involving my daughter.

On that day, she was taken to the emergency department at the Hospital Sagrado Corazón de Jesús in Quevedo, Ecuador, where she was diagnosed with a severe headache (ICD10: G44.X) and prescribed 24 hours of strict bed rest. This unexpected health issue required my full attention, and as a result, we were unable to check in to the hotel as originally planned.

I have attached the official medical certificate issued by the attending physician for verification. I kindly ask for your consideration in processing a refund or credit for a future booking.

Thank you for your understanding.
