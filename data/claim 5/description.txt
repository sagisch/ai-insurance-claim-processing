Hi there,

I’m writing to explain why I had to cancel my flight on such short notice.

On October 31st, I suddenly felt really shitty while at work at the retirement home (Casa di Riposo Sant’Anna). I left around 12:30 PM and was checked out by the doctor on site, Dr. Lucini Cristina. She confirmed I wasn’t in a condition to keep working or travel and told me to follow up with my own doctor. I've attached her note here.

Unfortunately, my flight to Palermo was scheduled for the next morning, and I just wasn’t physically up for it. I had to cancel the whole trip. I’m hoping this qualifies under the medical emergency clause of my travel insurance.

Thanks in advance for your help,  
Olivier Bayante
