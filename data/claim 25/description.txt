Due to an unexpected dental emergency that occurred on the morning of July 12, 2024, I was forced to cancel my trip and could not make use of the hotel reservation made through Booking.com.

The emergency appointment was necessary to treat an acute abscess, which required immediate intervention, as confirmed by the attached dental certificate.

I am therefore requesting a refund for the unused booking.

Kind regards,
Daniel Müller
