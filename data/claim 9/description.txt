I am writing to file a claim under my travel insurance policy for missing my flight originally scheduled for 29 July 2023. On that same day, I underwent emergency eye surgery (pterygium excision) at Centro Médico Integral NOVAMEDIC, which rendered me unfit to travel and required a 15-day rest period.

The procedure was unplanned and medically necessary. I have attached the medical certificate, confirming the surgery and the rest period from 29 July to 12 August 2023.

As a result, I was unable to take my flight to Quito that afternoon. 

Since i was unable to take the flight, so please compensate me the full ticket price of 129 euros.

Thank you in advance
