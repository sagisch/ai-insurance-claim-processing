Hi,

I'm reaching out early to cancel our upcoming flight for August 15. My partner, Jorge Velosa Ruiz, has been hospitalized since the night of July 22 after we rushed to the ER at Clínica Reina Sofía. He was moved to a hospital room the next morning and is still admitted.

We were supposed to fly to Miami together on the 15th, but there's no way he'll be discharged or fit to travel by then. I’ve attached the certificate from the clinic that confirms everything.

I wanted to let you know ahead of time since we already know we won’t be able to make the trip. Hoping this qualifies under the medical emergency policy for cancellation.

Thanks for understanding,  
Marta Rojas Valbuena
