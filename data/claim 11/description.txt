Hi,

I’m submitting a claim for a missed domestic flight on 25 January 2023. I had a severe migraine attack that day and had to go to the Hospital around noon. I was advised to rest for at least 12 hours due to the side effects of the treatment.

The episode was triggered by food I’m allergic to, which I had unknowingly eaten a day earlier. I’ve attached the doctor’s note confirming the consultation and the prescribed rest. Unfortunately, I was not able to make it to the airport in time for my flight.

Please let me know if you need anything else from my side. Thanks.
