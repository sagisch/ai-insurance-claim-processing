To whom it may concern,

I am writing to request a refund for a flight that was missed on August 10, 2016, due to a last-minute medical check-up required for my daughter, LUCÍA FERNÁNDEZ, who was 12 years old at the time.

On the same day of the scheduled flight, she underwent a full medical evaluation at a government-certified medical facility in the State of Mexico. The check-up was mandated to assess her physical fitness and included detailed measurements, visual acuity tests, and other clinical evaluations.

Although she was declared clinically healthy, the unforeseen scheduling and duration of this mandatory appointment made it impossible for us to arrive at the airport on time.

I respectfully request a refund for the missed flight and attach the official medical certificate issued by Dr. Franco R. Hernández Marín as supporting documentation.

Thank you for your attention and understanding.

Sincerely,
ALEJANDRA FERNÁNDEZ
