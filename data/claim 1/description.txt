I was unable to check in at Ganga Vatika Boutique Hotel in Rishikesh on March 25, 2024, due to a sudden medical emergency involving my daughter, who experienced a severe allergic reaction the night before our scheduled departure.

We had to seek immediate medical attention, and as a result, we had to cancel our travel plans entirely. I understand the booking was listed as non-refundable, but given the unforeseen nature of the situation, I am kindly requesting a refund or partial compensation.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker
