Hi,

I'm submitting this claim because my mom, Gloria Mi Nano Reyna, had to cancel her flight scheduled for September 13. She had been hospitalized at Clínica Sánchez Ferrer starting August 13 and only just got discharged after we were supposed to leave.

Even though we were hoping she’d recover in time, her condition was still too fragile to travel. The hospital issued a certificate confirming her hospitalization, and I’ve attached it here.

We had booked a trip from Trujillo to Buenos Aires, and unfortunately could not start it.

Thanks a lot for your support,  
Luis Mi Nano
