      "confidence": "0.92",
      "explanation": "The claim is denied because the only document is a booking confirmation that lists a different guest name (naveen kumar) and a non\u2011refundable policy, and the claimant failed to provide the required medical report or other authoritative proof of the alleged emergency, creating insufficient and suspicious documentation."

      "claim_id": 2,
      "decision": "DENY",
      "confidence": "0.86",
      "explanation": "Denied: the provided medical certificate documents a routine fitness check for 'Montserrat Becerril Galv\u00e1n' (not the claimant's daughter LUC\u00cdA FERN\u00c1NDEZ), shows she was clinically healthy (not an emergency), and there is no evidence the appointment actually prevented timely arrival for the flight\u2014creating a critical name/date/timing inconsistency and indicating a non-covered reason or potentially fraudulent/inapplicable documentation."

      "decision": "APPROVE",
      "confidence": "0.88",
      "explanation": "The medical certificate from Hospital Vozandes dated 25-Jan-2023 documents an 11:45\u201312:52 visit with a prescribed 12-hour rest and the provided booking confirmation (flight LA1353, 25-Jan-2023 15:10) matches the claimant and fare, satisfying the policy's medical emergency and proof-of-booking requirements with timely, consistent evidence and no clear signs of fabrication."

      "claim_id": 4,
      "decision": "APPROVE",
      "confidence": "0.88",
      "explanation": "Supporting evidence includes a paid booking for 02/12/2022 in the claimant's name and a dated hospital certificate (stamped and signed by Dr Ndama Niang) stating Mme Amy Ndiaye was hospitalized since 01/12/2022 for an abdominal trauma preventing travel, which satisfies the policy requirement for a medical emergency with valid documentation."

    {
      "claim_id": 5,
      "decision": "UNCERTAIN",
      "confidence": "0.78",
      "explanation": "The certificate states hospitalization from 16/12/2023 to 17/12/2023 which would cover the missed flight, but it is dated 17/11/2023 (predating the stay), a clear inconsistency that makes the document suspicious \u2014 request authentic hospital records/discharge summary or a corrected signed certificate with verifiable contact details before approving."

      "decision": "DENY",
      "confidence": "0.9",
      "explanation": "The submitted medical certificate (dated 05/09/2018) explicitly indicates no current contraindication to sporting activity (including competition) for Lily Fang and does not state she was unfit to participate or provide a period of incapacity, so the documentation contradicts the claimant's assertion and fails to prove a covered medical inability to attend the paid stage."

      "claim_id": 7,
      "decision": "DENY",
      "confidence": "0.87",
      "explanation": "The submitted pathology report (dated 27.06.2007) documents a medical procedure but the patient name is not clearly the claimant (shows initials/redacted name R.; G. and birthdate), so the supporting documentation is incomplete/suspicious and does not validly link the medical emergency to Roy Hoffman as required by the policy."

      "claim_id": 9,
      "decision": "DENY",
      "confidence": "0.92",
      "explanation": "The medical certificate is unsigned, undated, lacks treating-physician details and explicitly states the claimant is 'apto para actividad f\u00edsica', which contradicts the stated inability to attend and therefore is incomplete/ inconsistent and does not support a covered medical cancellation."

      "confidence": "0.9",
      "explanation": "Although the booking and no\u2011show are documented, the claimant has not provided a valid medical certificate or official signed admission/discharge report with dates and physician details (only a selfie outside a hospital is included), so the required supporting medical documentation for a covered medical emergency is missing and the claim cannot be approved."

      "decision": "APPROVE",
      "confidence": "0.8",
      "explanation": "The paid booking for 20 Sep 2013 matches the missed train, and a contemporaneous medical certificate documents an acute gastroenteritis diagnosis on that date with a 72-hour rest recommendation, the claim was reported within days and I find no clear inconsistencies or obvious signs of document tampering."

      "claim_id": 12,
      "decision": "DENY",
      "confidence": "0.8",
      "explanation": "Only a boarding pass is provided \u2014 there is no airline delay/arrival confirmation or incident report and no proof/receipt of the $113 prepaid clinic charge, and under the policy missed-connection claims require documentary evidence of the delay and proof of payment, so the claim is incomplete and cannot be approved."

      "confidence": "0.8",
      "explanation": "Although the booking proof is valid, the claimant did not submit the required medical certificate or hospital report to corroborate the asserted urgent medical emergency (the claimant only states the document 'can be provided upon request'), and under the policy incomplete/suspicious documentation requires denial."

      "claim_id": 15,
      "decision": "DENY",
      "confidence": "0.86",
      "explanation": "Deny \u2014 the booking is proven but the supporting medical certificate explicitly states the claimant was in 'perfecto estado de salud' (no medical emergency), the stated reason (administrative/legal delays during a medical visit) is not a covered cancellation reason and there is no police/jury/urgent medical report or other required documentation to justify reimbursement; the evidence is therefore insufficient and partly contradictory."
