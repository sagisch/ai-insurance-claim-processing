  "claim_id": 10,
  "decision": "DENY",
  "confidence": "0.9",
  "explanation": "Although the booking and no‑show are documented, the claimant has not provided a valid medical certificate or official signed admission/discharge report with dates and physician details (only a selfie outside a hospital is included), so the required supporting medical documentation for a covered medical emergency is missing and the claim cannot be approved."
