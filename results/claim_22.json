  "claim_id": 22,
  "decision": "APPROVE",
  "confidence": "0.86",
  "explanation": "The submitted clinic certificate (hospital letter, stamp and signature) names Jorge Luis Velosa Ruiz, gives admission on 22–23 July and confirms he was still hospitalized as of 27 July, which, together with the provided booking details for the 15 August flight, supports a covered medical-emergency cancellation and the documentation appears consistent and complete."
