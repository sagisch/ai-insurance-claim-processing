  "claim_id": 25,
  "decision": "APPROVE",
  "confidence": "0.88",
  "explanation": "The medical certificate from Centro Médico Integral NOVAMEDIC clearly documents emergency pterygium surgery on 29-07-2023 with a prescribed 15-day rest (29-07-2023 to 12-08-2023) covering the missed flight date, and the booking record shows the matching passenger name, flight and fare (€129), so the claim meets policy requirements despite a minor spelling variation in the given name.
