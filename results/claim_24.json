  "claim_id": 24,
  "decision": "APPROVE",
  "confidence": "0.92",
  "explanation": "The submitted hospital admission/discharge record (12/13–12/14) with physician signature documents an acute medical emergency and a 48-hour travel restriction that overlaps the 12/14 flight, and the booking confirmation/receipt corroborates the paid reservation, meeting the policy requirements for a covered medical trip cancellation with no apparent inconsistencies."
