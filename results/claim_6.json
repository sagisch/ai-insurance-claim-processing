  "claim_id": 6,
  "decision": "DENY",
  "confidence": "0.9",
  "explanation": "The submitted medical certificate (dated 05/09/2018) explicitly indicates no current contraindication to sporting activity (including competition) for Lily Fang and does not state she was unfit to participate or provide a period of incapacity, so the documentation contradicts the claimant's assertion and fails to prove a covered medical inability to attend the paid stage."
